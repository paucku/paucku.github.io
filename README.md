# Raicho Nikolov's bio

This is my bio. I was born... 

That was the king of bios 20-25 years ago in Bulgaria. It was very important to about yout father and mother and to not miss your sister. 

I've been thinking what I consider is the most important about me. Was it the positions I've held? Was it the skills I've developed?

I think the most important is the experience as a whole and where it leads me. What kind of person and professional I am now because of that? What kind of jobs I am capable of doing?

My experience is both technical and people related. I've been a programmer, web developer, teacher, web developer... but also restaurant worker, insurance salesman and financial advisor. I am not shining with great successes but seem to have srafted some neat skills.

I am fascinated with technology. I see how technology can easify the everyday chores so we can focus on more important things to do. But I am also frustrated by technology because somehow with all this development in the area of smartphones, tablets and other useful tools, it is not so much easy to achieve the result you want without researching the internet, reading a lot and trying things that allegedly work for someone but not for you. My relationship with thechnology is excitemnt/frustration one.

I am also fascinated with business. Business is probably the only way to sustain a cause for decades. If you think that you have a mission in life you should create a sustainable business arround the idea.

That is why I want to work at Basecamp. I want to learn how to make a successful busienss, how to focus and how to help users to do their jobs without the need to think about the tools they use, without worshiping the tool (Apple) and without trying to hook them and force them to use my products even if they don't need it.
